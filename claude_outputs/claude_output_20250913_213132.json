Representative of other coordination protocols\n\n## 26.5 Recall: 2PC Summary\nWhy is 2PC not subject to the General's paradox?\n→ Because 2PC is about all nodes eventually coming to the same decision – not necessarily at the same time!\n→ Allowing us to reboot and continue allows time for collecting and collating decisions\n\nBiggest downside of 2PC: blocking\n→ A failed node can prevent the system from making progress\n→ Still one of the most popular coordination algorithms today\n\n## 26.6 Failures\nWhat types of failures can arise in distributed system?\n→ Crash\n→ Omission\n→ Arbitrary Failures (Byzantine)\n\n## 26.7 Failure Model as a Contract\nA system with N replicas will:\n1. Remain safe (produce a correct output)\n2. Remain live (eventually produce correct output)\n\nAs long as there are no more than F failures.\n\nWhat happens when there are more than f failures?\n→ All bets are off.\n\n## 26.8 Solving Consensus\nHow can we get a group of machines to agree on a single value when:\n1. There can be concurrent values proposed\n2. Machines can fail!\n\n2PC blocks in the presence of failures and requires explicit coordinator. How can we solve consensus in the presence of f failures?\n\n## 26.9 Consensus\nGiven a set of processors, each with an initial value:\n→ **Termination**: All non-faulty processes eventually decide on a value\n→ **Agreement**: All processes that decide do so on the same value\n→ **Validity**: Value decided must have proposed by some process\n\n## 26.10 Consensus Impossibility\n→ Consensus is impossible in an asynchronous system!\n\n**Realisation 1**: Every *fun* thing in distributed systems is impossible\n\n**Realisation 2**: We build these systems anyways.\n\n## 26.11 Paxos\n→ Most popular consensus algorithm but doesn't (quite) solve consensus\n→ Provides safety and eventual liveness\n\n**Safety**: Consensus is not violated\n**Eventual Liveness**: If things go well sometime in the future (messages, failures, etc.), there is a good chance consensus will be reached. But there is no guarantee.\n\nUsed (in some form) in most major distributed systems:\n→ Google's Chubby, Yahoo's Zookeeper, MultiPaxos in Spanner, Raft in Etcd/TiKV\n\n## 26.12 System Model\n→ 2f + 1 nodes, f of which may fail\n→ No upper-bound in message delivery *but* assume messages eventually arrive\n→ No \"special\" coordinator node. Everyone is equal\n→ Propose values (data/numbers, etc)\n\n## 26.13 Greek Island Politics\n\"the problem of governing with a part-time parliament bears a remarkable correspondence to the problem faced by today's fault-tolerant distributed systems, where legislators correspond to processes and leaving the Chamber corresponds to failing. The Paxons' solution may therefore be of some interest to computer scientists. I present here a short history of the Paxos Parliament's protocol, followed by an even shorter discussion of its relevance for distributed systems\"\n\nNo one really understood this version, so there's been many \"translations\" for Computer Scientists since:\n→ Paxos Made Simple\n→ Paxos Made Moderately Complex\n→ An Engineering Perspective on Paxos\n→ Viewstamp Replication\n→ Raft\n\n## 26.14 Rounds\nPaxos has rounds:\n→ Each round has a unique ballot id\n→ Rounds are asynchronous\n→ Time synchronization not required (but preferred for liveness)\n→ If you're in round j and hear a message from round j+1, abort everything and move over to round j+1\n\n## 26.15 Three Phases Per Round\nEach round itself broken into phases (which are also asynchronous):\n→ **Phase 1**: A leader is elected (Election)\n→ **Phase 2**: Leader proposes a value, processes ack (Bill)\n→ **Phase 3**: Leader multicasts final value (Law)\n\n## 26.16 Phase 1 – Election\n→ Potential leader (Proposer) chooses a ballot id\n→ Ballot id must be unique per proposer\n→ Ballot id must be higher than any ballot id seen anything so far\n\n## 26.17 Phase 1 – Election (Version 1)\nProposer sends PREPARE(ballot_id) to all participants.\n\nIf participant has already received a higher ballot id (b > ballot_id), do nothing.\nElse:\n1. Store b=ballot_id on disk\n2. Send an PROMISE(ballot_id) to proposer\n\nx Have I already agreed to ignore proposals with this proposal number?\n\n## 26.18 Phase 1 – Election (Version 1) Continued\n→ If majority (i.e., quorum) respond PROMISE(ballot_id) then, proposer is the leader\n→ Why a majority?\n→ In what cases may the leader not receive a majority of votes?\n\n**Invariant**: once have established a leader for ballot_id, no leader can be elected for a ballot smaller than ballot_id\n\n## 26.19 Phase 2 – Proposal (Bill) (Version 1)\nLeader sends proposed value v by sending PROPOSE(ballot_id,v) to all\n\nIf participant has already received a higher ballot id (b > ballot_id), do nothing.\nElse:\n1. Store b=ballot_id on disk\n2. Send an ACCEPT(ballot_id, v) to proposer\n\nx Have I already agreed to ignore proposals with this proposal number?\n\n## 26.20 Phase 3 – Decision (Law) (Version 1)\n→ If leader hears a majority of ACCEPT(ballot_id, v), it lets everyone know of the decision\n→ Sends a COMMIT(ballot_id, v)\n→ Participants can now execute v\n\n## 26.21-26.44 Examples and Problems\n\n### Easy Example\n→ Prepare(1) → Promise(1) → Propose(1, \"soccer\") → Accept(1) → Commit(1, \"soccer\")\n\n### Moderately Easy Example\nDemonstrates quorum handling when multiple ballots compete\n\n### Harder Example\nShows problem where consensus breaks down:\n→ Agreement violation: All processes that decide do so on the same value\n→ Consensus happens but participants don't know it yet\n\n## 26.45-26.49 Paxos Version 2 Corrections\n\n### Phase 1 – Election (Version 2)\nProposer sends PREPARE(ballot_id) to all participants.\n\nIf highest ballot id received so far, send PROMISE(ballot_id)\nIf already sent an ACCEPT(old_ballot,value), send PROMISE(ballot_id, (old_ballot,value))\nOtherwise do nothing\n\nx Have I already agreed to ignore proposals < ballot_id\nx Have I already potentially decided a value?\n\nIf majority respond PROMISE(ballot_id, (old_ballot, v)):\n→ Select v with highest \"old_ballot\" value. Must propose v\n→ Leader not free to choose value as consensus may already have been reached!\n\n### Phase 2 – Proposal (Bill) (Version 2)\nLeader sends PROPOSE(ballot_id,v) to all (where v is either leader's value or result of PROMISE message)\n\nIf participant has already received a higher ballot id (b > ballot_id), do nothing.\nElse:\n1. Store b=ACCEPT(ballot_id, v) on disk\n2. Send an ACCEPT(ballot_id, v) to proposer\n\n## 26.50-26.60 Version 2 Examples\n→ Demonstrates how Version 2 maintains consensus\n→ Because consensus *may* have happened on a value, proposer must re-propose it\n\n## 26.61 Core Safety Theorem\nIf some round has a majority (i.e., quorum) accepting value v, then subsequently at each round either:\n1. the round chooses v as decision or\n2. the round fails\n\n→ Recall that cannot prove liveness! (Think of proposers livelocking)\n\n## 26.62 Core Safety Theorem Proof Intuition\n→ Majority of acceptors accept (n, v): v is chosen\n→ Receive 2f+1 promise messages\n→ If 2f+1 participants accepted v in round r, for all rounds r'>r, proposer will receive at least one PROMISE(r', (r,v))\n\n## 26.63 Coordination – Paxos Summary\n→ Decide a single value at once. Always safe, mostly live\n→ Three phases. Eventual (not simultaneous) agreement\n→ Real implementations of Paxos decide on a \"log\" (MultiPaxos, Viewstamp Replication)\n\n## 26.64 Topic Roadmap\n→ Distributed File Systems\n→ Peer-To-Peer System: The Internet\n→ Distributed Data Processing\n→ Coordination (Atomic Commit and Consensus)\n\n## 26.65 Topic Breakdown\n**Virtualizing the CPU**\n→ Process Abstraction and API\n→ Threads and Concurrency\n→ Scheduling\n\n**Virtualizing Memory**\n→ Virtual Memory\n→ Paging\n\n**Persistence**\n→ IO devices\n→ File Systems\n\n**Distributed Systems**\n→ Challenges with distribution\n→ Data Processing & Storage"
