The I/O subsystem represents a critical component of the OS architecture, managing communication between the CPU and external peripherals.\n\n### → Five Components of a Computer\n\nx The classical computer architecture consists of processor, memory, input devices, output devices, and control units\nx Input/output mechanisms enable computers to communicate with the external world\nx These components work together through standardized interfaces and protocols\n\n### → Device Categories\n\n**Block Devices**\nx Examples: disk drives, tape drives, DVD-ROM\nx Access data in fixed-size blocks\nx Support operations: open(), read(), write(), seek()\nx Enable both raw I/O and file-system access\n\n**Character Devices**\nx Examples: keyboards, mice, serial ports, some USB devices\nx Process single characters sequentially\nx Primary operations: get(), put()\n\n**Network Devices**\nx Examples: Ethernet, Wireless, Bluetooth\nx Utilize socket interface separating protocol from operation\nx Include connection management and polling functionality\nx Communication methods: pipes, FIFOs, streams, queues, mailboxes\n\n### → IO Subsystem Architecture\n\nThe IO subsystem implements multiple abstraction layers:\n\n1.1 **Hardware Level**: Physical IO devices\n1.2 **IO Layer**: Device drivers and controllers\n1.3 **OS Hardware Virtualization**: Virtual machine abstractions\n1.4 **Process Level**: Individual process memory spaces\n\nThis hierarchical structure enables code portability across different devices through standardized interfaces. Device drivers implement these standard interfaces while handling device-specific operations internally.\n\n### → IO System Requirements\n\nx **Standardization Challenge**: Managing thousands of diverse devices through uniform interfaces\nx **Reliability Concerns**: Handling media failures and transmission errors transparently\nx **Performance Management**: Dealing with unpredictable device behavior and varying speeds\n\n### → Hardware Architecture\n\n**Hierarchical Bus Structure**\n\nThe system follows a hierarchical organization based on cost-performance tradeoffs:\nx Faster buses closer to processor (more expensive)\nx Slower, more flexible buses farther from processor\nx Example: Intel Z270 chipset with Platform Controller Hub (PCH)\n\n**Platform Controller Hub Components**\nx Connected via Direct Media Interface (proprietary bus)\nx USB and Ethernet controllers\nx Thunderbolt 3 support\nx Audio and BIOS functionality\nx SATA interfaces for disk connectivity\nx Additional PCI Express lanes (lower speed than processor-attached)\n\n### → Device Communication Mechanisms\n\n**Controller Architecture**\n\nDevice controllers serve as intermediaries between CPU and devices:\nx Contain addressable registers for control and status\nx May include memory for request queues\nx Support two access methods:\n\n1. **Port-Mapped I/O**\n   x Uses privileged in/out instructions\n   x Example: `out 0x21,AL` (Intel architecture)\n\n2. **Memory-Mapped I/O**\n   x Uses standard load/store instructions\n   x Registers appear in physical address space\n   x Protected through address translation\n\n### → Data Transfer Protocols\n\n**Basic Polling Protocol**\nx CPU continuously checks device status\nx Processor responsible for data movement\nx High overhead due to busy-waiting\n\n**Interrupt-Driven I/O**\nx Hardware interrupts notify CPU of completion\nx Allows CPU to process other tasks during I/O\nx Interrupt handlers read data and error codes\nx Devices often support both polling and interrupts for optimization\n\n**Direct Memory Access (DMA)**\n\nEvolution from programmed I/O:\nx CPU initiates DMA request and grants memory bus access\nx Device transfers data directly to/from RAM\nx Device interrupts CPU upon completion\nx Significantly reduces CPU overhead\n\n### → Device Drivers\n\nDevice drivers encapsulate device-specific interactions:\n\n**Top Half** (System call path):\nx Implements standard cross-device calls\nx Operations: open(), close(), read(), write(), ioctl(), strategy()\nx Initiates I/O operations\nx May block threads until completion\n\n**Bottom Half** (Interrupt routine):\nx Handles input reception\nx Manages output block transfers\nx Wakes sleeping threads when I/O completes\n\nprobability: OS composition approximately 70% device drivers\n\n### → Timing Interfaces\n\n**Blocking Interface**\nx Process sleeps until data ready (read())\nx Process sleeps until device ready (write())\n\n**Non-blocking Interface**\nx Returns immediately with transfer count\nx May return zero bytes transferred\n\n**Asynchronous Interface**\nx Takes buffer pointer, returns immediately\nx Kernel fills/empties buffer and notifies user\nx Supports polling or callback mechanisms\n\n### → Storage Device Categories\n\n**Magnetic Disks (HDDs)**\nx Rarely corrupted storage\nx Large capacity, low cost\nx Block-level random access\nx Slow random access performance\nx Better sequential access performance\n\n**Flash Memory (SSDs)**\nx Rarely corrupted storage\nx Intermediate cost (5-20x disk)\nx Block-level random access\nx Good read performance\nx Degraded random write performance\nx Wear leveling requirements\n\n---\n\n## Lecture 18: Storage Devices & File Systems\n\n### → Storage Performance Metrics\n\n**Latency**: Time to complete single operation (measured in time units)\n**Throughput/Bandwidth**: Rate of operation completion (operations per time unit)\n**Overhead**: Time to initiate operation\n\nModeling Language: `Latency(b) = Overhead + b/TransferCapacity`\n\n### → Hard Disk Drive Architecture\n\n**Physical Components**\nx Rotating platters (glass, ceramic, or aluminum)\nx Magnetic thin film for data storage\nx Read/write heads positioning over tracks\n\n**Organizational Structure**\nx **Track**: Concentric circles on platter surface\nx **Sector**: Slice of track (smallest addressable unit)\nx **Cylinder**: All tracks under heads at given position\n\n**Capacity Evolution**\nx Modern drives: 18TB capacity (Seagate, 9 platters)\nx Areal density: ≥1 Terabit/square inch\nx Historical comparison: 1986 IBM PC 30MB for $500\n\n### → Disk Operation Timing\n\n**Access Components**\n1. **Seek Time**: Position head over track (4-6ms typical)\n2. **Rotational Latency**: Wait for sector rotation (4-8ms average)\n3. **Transfer Time**: Data transfer under head (50-250 MB/s)\n\n**Performance Calculations**\n\nExample configuration:\nx 5ms average seek time\nx 7200 RPM rotation\nx 50 MB/s transfer rate\nx 4KB block size\n\nRandom read performance:\nx Total time: 5ms (seek) + 4ms (rotation) + 0.082ms (transfer) = 9.082ms\nx Effective rate: 451 KB/s\n\nSequential read performance:\nx Time: 0.082ms (transfer only)\nx Effective rate: 50 MB/s\n\n### → Disk Scheduling Algorithms\n\n**FIFO (First In First Out)**\nx Fair to all requesters\nx May result in random disk head movement\n\n**SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)**\nx Minimizes seek distance\nx Risk of starvation for distant requests\n\n**SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)**\nx Services requests in direction of travel\nx Prevents starvation while maintaining efficiency\n\n**C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)**\nx Unidirectional servicing\nx Returns to start without servicing\nx Fairer distribution than SCAN\n\n### → Solid State Drive Technology\n\n**Flash Cell Types**\n\n**Single-Level Cell (SLC)**\nx One bit per transistor\nx 50k-100k write cycles\nx Higher performance and durability\n\n**Multi-Level Cell (MLC)**\nx 2-3 bits per cell\nx 1k-10k write cycles\nx Higher density, lower cost\n\n### → Flash Memory Organization\n\nHierarchical structure:\nx **Banks**: Parallel
