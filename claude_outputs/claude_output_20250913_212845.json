Data written to buffer cache is flushed to disk periodically, but may be lost if machine crashes before flush occurs.\n\n→ **Storage Reliability Problem**\n\nEven without buffer cache, file system data structures may be inconsistent after failure:\n- Single logical file operation can involve updates to multiple disk blocks (inode, indirect block, data block, bitmap)\n- Within storage device, single block write might update multiple sectors\n\nx **How do we guarantee consistency regardless of when crash occurs?**\n\n### 21.2 Reliability Approaches\n\n→ **Two Main Approaches**\n\n**1. Careful Ordering and Recovery (FAT & FFS + fsck)**\n- Each step builds structure: Data block → inode → free → directory\n- Last step links it into rest of FS\n- Recovery scans structure looking for incomplete actions\n\n**2. Versioning and Copy-on-Write (ZFS)**\n- Version files at some granularity\n- Create new structure linking back to unchanged parts of old\n- Last step declares new version ready\n\n→ **More General Solutions**\n\n**Transactions for atomic updates:**\n- Ensure multiple related updates performed atomically\n- If crash occurs in middle, state reflects either all or none of updates\n- Most modern file systems use transactions internally\n\n**Redundancy for media failures:**\n- Error Correcting Codes on media\n- Replication across media (e.g., RAID disk array)\n\n### 21.3 Transactions\n\n→ **Key Concept**\n\nA transaction is an atomic sequence of reads and writes that takes the system from one consistent state to another.\n\n- Extends concept of atomic updates from memory to persistent storage\n- Code in critical section appears atomic to other threads\n- Transactions extend this to persistent storage\n\n→ **Typical Transaction Structure**\n\n1. Begin transaction - get transaction ID\n2. Do bunch of updates\n   - If any fail, roll-back\n   - If conflicts with other transactions, roll-back\n3. Commit transaction\n\n→ **Transaction Example: SQL**\n\n```sql\nBEGIN;    --BEGIN TRANSACTION\nUPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100.00 WHERE name = 'Alice';\nUPDATE branches SET balance = balance - 100.00 WHERE name = ...;\nUPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00 WHERE name = 'Bob';\nUPDATE branches SET balance = balance + 100.00 WHERE name = ...;\nCOMMIT;   --COMMIT WORK\n```\n\n### 21.4 Logging and Journaling\n\n→ **The Log as Tool**\n\nOne simple action is atomic - write/append basic item. Use that to seal commitment to whole series of actions:\n- Start Tran N\n- Get 10$ from account A\n- Get 7$ from account B  \n- Get 13$ from account C\n- Put 15$ into account X\n- Put 15$ into account Y\n- Commit Tran N\n\n→ **Transactional File Systems**\n\nBetter reliability through use of log:\n- Changes to all FS data structures treated as transactions\n- Transaction committed once fully written to log\n- Data forced to disk for reliability\n- Process can be accelerated with NVRAM\n\n**Difference between Log Structured and Journaling file systems:**\n- Log Structured: data stays in log form\n- Journaling: log only used for recovery\n\n### 21.5 Journaling File System Operation\n\n→ **Creating File with Journaling**\n\nProcess:\n1. Find free data block(s)\n2. Find free inode entry\n3. Find dirent insertion point\n4. [log] Write map (mark used)\n5. [log] Write inode entry to point to block(s)\n6. [log] Write dirent to point to inode\n\nLog contains: start marker, pending operations, commit marker\n\n→ **After Commit**\n\n- All accesses to file system first look in log\n- Actual on-disk data structure might be stale\n- Eventually copy changes to disk and discard transaction from log\n\n→ **Crash Recovery**\n\n**Discard Partial Transactions:**\n- Upon recovery, scan log\n- Detect transaction start with no commit\n- Discard log entries\n- Disk remains unchanged\n\n**Keep Complete Transactions:**\n- Scan log, find start\n- Find matching commit\n- Redo as usual or let happen later\n\n→ **Journaling Summary**\n\n**Why go through this trouble?**\n- Updates atomic, even if we crash\n- Update either fully applied or discarded\n- All physical operations treated as logical unit\n\n**Cost considerations:**\n- Writing all data twice (once to log, once to actual blocks)\n- Modern filesystems journal metadata updates only\n\n## Lecture 22: Distributed File Systems & Internet\n\n### 22.1 Distributed Systems Introduction\n\n→ **What is a Distributed System?**\n\n\"A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn't even know existed can render your own computer unusable.\" - Leslie Lamport\n\n→ **Two Types of Distributed Systems**\n\n**Client/Server Model:**\n- One or more servers provide services to clients\n- Clients make remote procedure calls to server\n- Server serves requests from clients\n\n**Peer-to-Peer Model:**\n- Each computer acts as peer\n- No hierarchy or central coordination point\n- All-way communication between peers through gossiping\n\n### 22.2 Promise and Challenges\n\n→ **Promise of Distributed Systems**\n\n**Availability:** Proportion of time system is functioning\n- One machine goes down, use another\n\n**Fault-tolerance:** System has well-defined behavior when fault occurs\n- Store data in multiple locations\n\n**Scalability:** Ability to add resources to support more work\n- Just add machines when need more storage/processing\n\n**Transparency:** System masks complexity behind simple interface\n- Location, Migration, Replication, Concurrency, Parallelism, Fault Tolerance\n\n→ **Challenges of Distributed Systems**\n\n- How do you get machines to communicate?\n- How do you get machines to coordinate?\n- How do you deal with failures?\n- How do you deal with security (corrupted machines)?\n\n### 22.3 Communication in Distributed Systems\n\n→ **Protocols**\n\nA protocol is agreement on how to communicate, covering:\n- **Syntax:** how communication is specified & structured\n  - Format, order messages are sent and received\n- **Semantics:** what communication means\n  - Actions taken when transmitting, receiving, or timer expires\n\n→ **Message Passing**\n\nInterface:\n- Mailbox (mbox): temporary holding area for messages\n- Send(message,mbox)\n- Receive(buffer,mbox)\n\n→ **Data Representation**\n\nObject in memory has machine-specific binary representation. Externalizing object requires turning it into sequence of bytes:\n\n- **Serialization/Marshalling:** Express object as sequence of bytes\n- **Deserialization/Unmarshalling:** Reconstruct object from marshalled form\n\n**Endianness consideration:**\n- Big Endian: most significant byte stored first\n- Little Endian: least significant byte stored first\n\n**Common formats:** JSON, XML, Protocol Buffers\n\n### 22.4 Remote Procedure Call (RPC)\n\n→ **RPC Concept**\n\nMakes communication look like ordinary function call:\n- Automates complexity of translating between representations\n- Client calls: `remoteFileSystem→Read(\"file.txt\")`\n- Translated automatically into call on server: `fileSys→Read(\"file.txt\")`\n\n→ **RPC Implementation**\n\nRequest-response message passing under covers:\n- Client stub: marshalls arguments, unmarshalls return values\n- Server stub: unmarshalls arguments, marshalls return values\n\n**Stub generator:** Compiler that generates stubs\n- Input: interface definitions in IDL\n- Output: stub code in appropriate source language\n\n→ **RPC Details**\n\n**Binding:** Converting user-visible name into network endpoint\n- Static: fixed at compile time\n- Dynamic: performed at runtime via name service\n\n**Multiple servers:** \n- Choose unloaded server at binding time\n- Router level redirect for load balancing\n\n→ **Problems with RPC**\n\n**Non-Atomic Failures:**\n- Different failure modes than single machine\n- Can result in inconsistent view of world\n- Solution: Distributed transactions/2PC\n\n**Performance:**\n- Cost: Procedure call << same-machine RPC << network RPC\n- Overheads: Marshalling, Stubs, Kernel-Crossing, Communication\n- Programmers must be aware RPC is not free\n\n### 22.5 Distributed File Systems\n\n→ **Concept**\n\nTransparent access to files stored on remote disk:\n- Mount remote files into local file system\n- Directory in local file system refers to remote files\n\n**Naming choices:**\n- [Hostname,localname]: Filename includes server\n- Global name space: Filename unique in \"world\"\n\n→ **Virtual Filesystem Switch (VFS)**\n\nVirtual abstraction of file system in many OSes:\n- Provides virtual superblocks, inodes, files\n- Compatible with variety of local and remote file systems\n- Same system call interface for different file system types\n\n→ **Simple Distributed File System**\n\nRemote Disk: Reads and writes forwarded to server using RPC\n\n**Advantages:** Server provides consistent view to multiple clients\n\n**Problems - Performance:**\n- Network slower than local memory\n- Lots of network traffic/not well pipelined\n- Server can be bottleneck\n\n→ **Caching to Reduce Network Load**\n\nUse buffer cache at source and destination\n\n**Advantage:** If operations can be done locally, no network traffic needed\n\n**Problems:**\n- Failure: Client caches have uncommitted data\n- Cache consistency: Client caches not consistent with server/each other\n\n### 22.6 Network File System (NFS)\n\n→ **NFS Architecture**\n\nIntroduced by Sun in 1986 as open protocol\n\nThree layers:\n1. UNIX file-system interface: open, read, write, close + file descriptors\n2. VFS layer: distinguishes local from remote files\n3. NFS service layer: implements NFS protocol\n\n→ **NFS Protocol Features**\n\n**Stateless servers:** Each request provides all arguments required\n- E.g., ReadAt(inumber,position), not Read(openfile)\n- No network open() or close() needed\n\n**Idempotent operations:** Multiple requests have same effect as one\n- Read/write file blocks: just re-read or re-write\n- Remove: operation done twice returns advisory error\n\n**Write-through caching:** Modified data committed to server's disk before returning result\n- NSF2: every write persisted\n- NSF3: open-to-close consistency\n\n→ **NFS Cache Consistency**\n\n**Weak consistency:**\n- Client polls server periodically (3-30 seconds timeout)\n- When file changed on one client, other clients use old version until timeout\n- Multiple writers: can get either version or parts of both\n\n**Failure Model:** Transparent to client system\n- Options: Hang until server returns OR Return error\n\n→ **NFS Pros and Cons**\n\n**Pros:**\n- Simple, highly portable\n\n**Cons:**\n- Sometimes inconsistent\n- Doesn't scale to large # clients\n- Server becomes bottleneck due to polling traffic\n\n### 22.7 The Internet\n\n→ **Internet as Distributed System**\n\nLargest distributed system that exists:\n- Many different applications (Email, web, P2P)\n- Many different operating systems and devices\n- Many different network styles and technologies\n\nOrganization: Layering & end-to-end principle\n\n→ **The Hourglass Model**\n\n\"Narrow waist\" facilitates interoperability:\n- Physical layer\n- Data Link layer\n- **IP (Internet Protocol) - the waist**\n- Transport layer (TCP/UDP)\n- Application layer\n\n**Implications:**\n- Any network supporting IP can exchange packets\n- Applications using IP can use any network\n- Supports simultaneous innovations above and below IP\n- But changing IP itself very involved\n\n→ **Drawbacks of Layering**\n\n- Layer N may duplicate layer N-1 functionality\n- Layers may need same information\n- Layering can hurt performance\n- Some layers not always cleanly separated\n\n### 22.8 End-to-End Principle\n\n→ **Core Argument**\n\n\"End-to-End Arguments in System Design\" by Saltzer, Reed, and Clark ('84)\n\nSimple Message: Some network functionality can only be correctly implemented end-to-end\n- Reliability, security, etc.\n- Hosts cannot rely on network help, must implement themselves\n\n→ **Example: Reliable File Transfer**\n\n**Solution 1:** Make each step reliable, concatenate them\n**Solution 2:** End-to-end check and retry if necessary\n\nSolution 1 incomplete - what if memory corrupted?\nSolution 2 complete - full functionality at application layer\n\n→ **Interpretations**\n\n**Conservative:** Don't implement function at lower levels unless can be completely implemented there\n\n**Moderate:** Think twice before implementing in network\n- If hosts can implement correctly, lower layer only for performance enhancement\n- Only if doesn't burden applications not requiring functionality"
