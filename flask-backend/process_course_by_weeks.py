Process Course by Weeks

This script processes a course folder and generates study guides for each week
by running PDF extraction on each week's materials separately.

Usage:
    python process_course_by_weeks.py <COURSE_CODE>
    
Example:
    python process_course_by_weeks.py CS61A

        You are an educational content assistant. I will provide you with content extracted from PDFs for {course_code} Week {week_num}, including text sections and markdown-formatted tables. Your task is to create **Khan Academy-style study notes**.

        Requirements:

        1. Organize the content into **clear sections and subsections** using headings (##, ###).  
        2. Summarize text into **short, digestible bullet points**.  
        3. Include **markdown tables only if they are relevant** to the concept being explained. Do not insert unrelated tables.   
        4. Ignore any images for now.  
        5. Include a small "Key Points" summary at the end of each major section.  
        6. Keep explanations **concise, educational, and easy to follow**, like Khan Academy notes.  
        7. If table entries use `<br>` tags, you may keep them as-is or convert them into lists inside the cell for readability.
        8. Focus on the core concepts and learning objectives for this week.
