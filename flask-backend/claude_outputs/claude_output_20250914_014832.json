The course examines how operating systems manage hardware resources, provide abstractions for applications, and ensure security, reliability, and performance across diverse computing environments.\n\n## What is an Operating System?\n\n→ The OS is everywhere\nx Every device from smartwatches to laptops runs an operating system\nx Every program depends on the OS for performance and execution behavior\n\n→ Why is designing an OS hard?\nx Must interface across huge diversity of devices\nx Must handle operations across many timescales (nanoseconds to seconds)\nx Increasing complexity - modern systems contain 100+ million lines of code\nx Hardware becoming smarter for better reliability, security, energy efficiency, and performance\n\n→ Operating System Definition\nx Layer of software between hardware resources and applications\nx Implements a virtual machine with more convenient interface than raw hardware\nx Convenient means: security, reliability, portability\n\n## Three Main Roles of an OS\n\n→ Referee\nx Manage protection, isolation, and sharing of resources\nx Fault Isolation - isolate programs from each other and OS\nx Resource Sharing - choose which task to run next, split physical resources\nx Communication - support process communication through pipes/sockets\n\n→ Illusionist  \nx Provide clean, easy-to-use abstractions of physical resources\nx All alone - exclusive use of resources illusion\nx All expressive - abstract capabilities not physically present\nx All powerful - infinite hardware resources abstraction\n\n→ Glue\nx Provide set of common services\nx Maximize reuse - avoid re-implementing functionality\nx Make sharing easier with common primitives\nx Examples: File System, User Interface, Network\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\n→ Performance\nx Low overhead implementation\nx Fairness in resource distribution\nx Response time and throughput optimization\nx Predictability over time\n\n→ Reliability\nx System does what it's supposed to do\nx OS failures are catastrophic\nx Availability = mean time to failure + mean time to repair\n\n→ Security\nx Minimize vulnerability to attack\nx Integrity - operation cannot be compromised\nx Privacy - data accessible only to authorized users\nx Security Policy (what is permitted) vs Enforcement Policy (how to ensure)\n\n→ Portability\nx Abstractions don't change with hardware\nx Must plan for future hardware\nx Hardware Abstraction Layer enables portability\n\n## Protection: Processes and Kernels\n\n→ Requirements for Virtualization\nx Protect applications from each other (reliability, security, privacy)\nx Protect OS from applications\nx Protect against inequitable resource utilization\nx Protection preserves virtualization abstraction\n\n→ What is a Process?\nx Instance of a running program\nx Components:\n  · Memory (address space) - code, data, stack, heap\n  · CPU Registers - Program Counter, Stack Pointer\n  · IO information - open files\n\n→ Process Life Cycle\nx States: Running, Ready, Blocked, Dying\nx Transitions between states based on scheduling and I/O\n\n→ Process Management\nx Process Control Block (PCB) stores metadata:\n  · PC, Stack Pointer, Registers\n  · PID, UID\n  · List of open files\n  · Process State\nx Process Lists, Run Queues, Wait Queues\n\n## Kernel Protection Mechanisms\n\n→ Operating System Kernel\nx Lowest level of OS\nx Trusted with full hardware access\nx All other software considered untrusted\n\n→ User vs Kernel Mode\nx Kernel Code (Trusted) - unlimited rights, any hardware operations\nx User Code (Untrusted) - dangerous operations disabled\nx Both run on same machine\n\n## Hardware Requirements for Protection\n\n→ Privileged Instructions\nx Cannot change privilege level in user mode\nx Cannot change address space\nx Cannot disable interrupts\nx Cannot perform I/O operations\nx Cannot halt processor\n\n→ Memory Isolation\nx Memory accesses outside process address space prohibited\nx Applications cannot read/write kernel or other apps' memory\n\n→ Interrupts\nx Kernel can regain control from running process\nx Hardware timer interrupts after specified delay\nx Resetting timer is privileged operation\n\n→ Safe Transfers\nx Correctly transfer control between user and kernel mode\nx System calls - transition at OS-specified locations\nx Exceptions - privileged operation attempts generate processor exceptions\n\n## Course Structure\n\n→ Topic Breakdown\nx Virtualizing the CPU\n  · Process Abstraction and API\n  · Threads and Concurrency\n  · Scheduling\nx Virtualizing Memory\n  · Virtual Memory\n  · Paging\nx Persistence\n  · IO devices\n  · File Systems\nx Distributed Systems\n  · Challenges with distribution\n  · Data Processing & Storage\n\n→ Mechanisms vs Policy\nx Mechanism - low-level methods implementing functionality\nx Policy - algorithms for making decisions within OS"
